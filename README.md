# GoL_Sensehat
Game of Life Built for the Raspberry Pi SenseHat

The file GoL.py will play a small 8x8 Game of Life using the LEDs on a SenseHat with periodic boundary conditions. The original version was built at the Raspberry Pi Headquarters in Cambridge at the 10/01/2017 meeting of the Cambridge Python Users Groups.
